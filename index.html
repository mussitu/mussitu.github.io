      <h3>Hello Everyone:</h3>
      <main>
          <p><strong>Home Town: </strong>Freetown, Sierra Leone, West Africa.</p
          <p><strong>Education: </strong>Business & Information Systems</p>

          <p>
              My name is <strong>Musu Turay</strong>, an online graduate
              student majoring in Business & Information Systems. I work as a
              healthcare administrator in Austin, TX, and someday hope to
              become an IT consultant within the healthcare field.
          </p>
          <p>
              I started my masters online in Information Technology at
              Quinnipiac University, but decided to transfer to <a
              href="https://www.njit.edu">NJIT</a> this Fall. So far, I have
              taken classes in Data Management and Mining, SQL, Query etc, but
              still need to polish my skills in computers and technology, since
              I have no background in IT. My undergraduate degree was in
              International Studies (International Business focus).
          </p>
          <p>
              With this class, I hope to learn the skills necessary for me to
              grow and excel in my career. I also hope to obtain a certificate
              in BIS towards the end of my degree program at NJIT.
          </p>
          <p>
              <h4>Fun Facts:</h4>
              I enjoy traveling, meeting new people, and
              discovering new cultures.
